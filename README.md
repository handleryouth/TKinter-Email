This project requires some packages that need to be installed. for those of you who want to modify or compare your code, go ahead, I would be more than happy to hear it. For sending email using this project, you must first turn on access to Google's unsafe applications. you do this by opening the google website entitled "LessSecureApp" and after that you can freely send email with this application. Don't worry about hackers and anonymous data retrieval because this uses the secure connection provided by python
